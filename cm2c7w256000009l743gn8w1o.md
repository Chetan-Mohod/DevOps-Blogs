A simple way to understand Linux file permissions is to use numbers and letters. Here’s a quick guide:

### Numeric Representation

Each permission type has a value:

* **Read (r):** 4
    
* **Write (w):** 2
    
* **Execute (x):** 1
    

Add these values to get permission for each category (Owner, Group, Others). For example:

* `rwx` (read, write, execute) = 4 + 2 + 1 = **7**
    
* `rw-` (read, write) = 4 + 2 = **6**
    
* `r--` (read-only) = **4**
    

So, `rwxr-xr--` translates to **754**.

### Letter Representation

Think of permissions as three letters for each category:

* **Owner:** `rwx`
    
* **Group:** `r-x`
    
* **Others:** `r--`
    

### Mnemonic

Use the mnemonic “Read, Write, Execute” to remember the order, and the numbers 4, 2, and 1 for read, write, and execute.
