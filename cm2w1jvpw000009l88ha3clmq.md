The Linux filesystem is like a well-organized library. Every folder has a specific job, helping Linux keep things neat and efficient. Let’s take a quick tour from the top!

#### The Basics

* **/** (Root) - The foundation. Everything in Linux begins here, branching out like a tree.
    
* **/bin** - Essential commands. This is where tools like **ls** and **cp** live. Without **/bin**, you couldn’t even list files!
    
* **/boot** - Startup essentials. Holds the Linux kernel and bootloader, helping your system start up.
    
* **/dev** - Devices! Links to hardware like USBs and disks. It’s how Linux talks to the physical world.
    

#### Important Stops

* **/etc** - Configuration hub. This is the control center, holding files that shape your system’s behavior.
    
* **/home** - User space. Each user gets a personal directory here—your digital home base.
    
* **/var** - Dynamic data. Holds logs and temporary files that change often. Check **/var/log** when troubleshooting.
    

#### For the System

* **/lib** - Libraries. Supports essential binaries in **/bin** and **/sbin**.
    
* **/tmp** - Temporary storage. Holds files deleted on reboot. Great for temporary data, but don’t keep anything important here.
    
* **/usr** - User programs and apps. Where installed programs go, separated by user level.
    
* **/sbin** - Superuser binaries. Powerful commands like **shutdown**, reserved for admins.
    

#### For Advanced Users

* **/proc** & **/sys** - Live system data. Peek into these for CPU, memory, and other real-time details.
