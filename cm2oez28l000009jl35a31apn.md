Knowing the most commonly used ports in DevOps can make troubleshooting and configuration way easier. Here’s a quick overview of the top 10 ports every DevOps engineer should be familiar with:

1. **Port 22 (SSH)**
    
    * This is your go-to for secure remote access to servers. SSH (Secure Shell) encrypts your login session, making it ideal for remotely managing machines safely. It’s essential for server setups and automations.
        
2. **Port 80 (HTTP)**
    
    * The port we all encounter daily HTTP. It's the standard port for web traffic that isn’t encrypted. If you’re working with web servers, Port 80 will be a constant presence, handling unencrypted web data.
        
3. **Port 443 (HTTPS)**
    
    * HTTPS on Port 443 is the secure twin to Port 80, encrypting all traffic. It’s essential for any site or service needing secure communications, protecting user data from prying eyes.
        
4. **Port 3306 (MySQL)**
    
    * The default port for MySQL databases. If your project uses MySQL, this port is what connects your application to the database, making it critical for backend connectivity.
        
5. **Port 5432 (PostgreSQL)**
    
    * Similar to MySQL, this port is for PostgreSQL. It’s widely used for applications needing a robust, relational database, especially in environments prioritizing data integrity and reliability.
        
6. **Port 6379 (Redis)**
    
    * Redis uses this port. Known for its in-memory capabilities, Redis is a lifesaver for caching and speeding up applications. You’ll use Port 6379 frequently if you’re managing microservices or any high-performance app.
        
7. **Port 8080 (HTTP Alternative)**
    
    * Often used as an alternate to Port 80, this one comes in handy for development and testing environments. You might also see it used for proxy servers or additional web services.
        
8. **Port 5000 (Flask/Django Development)**
    
    * If you’re working with Python-based web apps like Flask or Django, you’ll see Port 5000 a lot. It’s commonly used for development servers, so you can preview your app locally.
        
9. **Port 27017 (MongoDB)**
    
    * This is the port MongoDB uses. A popular NoSQL database, MongoDB is ideal for applications that need flexible data models, and you’ll connect to it on Port 27017.
        
10. **Port 8443 (HTTPS Alternative)**
    

* An alternative HTTPS port, is often used for application servers when you need multiple secure services on the same machine. Great for development setups or when experimenting with SSL configurations.
