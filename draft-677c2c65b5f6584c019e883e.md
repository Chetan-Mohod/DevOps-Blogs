You can setup Master machine using Terraform you can do that or you can do using AWS. I’m creating it with Terraform.

## **Steps to Create Master Server: (1st Step)**

1. Open VS Code and make a new folder for the project. Then, check if the AWS CLI is set up on your system by running mentioned commands. If it's not set up, follow these steps to learn how to do it: [Click here](https://devops-concepts-by-chetan.hashnode.dev/terraform-your-way-to-aws-mastery-build-s3-iam-and-ec2-like-a-pro#heading-2-aws-cli).

2. Now we will clone the source code from our GitHub. Check out this [repo](https://github.com/Chetan-Mohod/DevSecOps-Project.git)
    

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chetan-Mohod/DevSecOps-Project.git
```

3. Now switch to the **start** branch:
    

```bash
#Switch to another branch
git checkout start

#Check current branch name
git branch
```

* You will see only the `src` folder here.
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1736317516610/34eb229f-7e0d-401d-9e0f-768341c2d8c0.png align="center")

* Lets create a folder called terraform in DevSecOps-Project where we will create our EC2 Instance.
    
    * Create `ec2.tf` where we will write our all code.
        
    * Create `terraform.tf` where we will create our configurations.
        
    * Create `variables.tf` where we will store our variables.
        
* You can refer this [repository](https://github.com/Chetan-Mohod/terraform-for-devops) to create an EC2 Instance.
    

*Note: If you're new to Terraform, please refer to the blogs I have shared. If you're already familiar with it, you can proceed with the next steps.*

* Below are the Terraform code for ec2.tf, terraform.tf and variables.tf:
    

```bash
data "aws_ami" "os_image" {    #We're using data just to get the recent OS AMI ID
  owners = ["099720109477"]
  most_recent = true
  filter {
    name   = "state"
    values = ["available"]
  }
  filter {
    name = "name"
    values = ["ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/*amd64*"]
  }
}

resource "aws_key_pair" "deployer" {
  key_name   = "bankapp-automate-key"
  public_key = file("bankapp-automate-key.pub")
}

resource "aws_default_vpc" "default" {

}

resource "aws_security_group" "allow_user_to_connect" {
  name        = "allow TLS"
  description = "Allow user to connect"
  vpc_id      = aws_default_vpc.default.id
  ingress {
    description = "port 22 allow ssh"
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  egress {
    description = " allow all outgoing traffic "
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  ingress {
    description = "port 80 allow http"
    from_port   = 80
    to_port     = 80
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  ingress {
    description = "port 443 allow https"
    from_port   = 443
    to_port     = 443
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  tags = {
    Name = "bankapp-security"
  }
}

resource "aws_instance" "testinstance" {
  ami             = data.aws_ami.os_image.id
  instance_type   = var.instance_type
  key_name        = aws_key_pair.deployer.key_name
  security_groups = [aws_security_group.allow_user_to_connect.name]
  tags = {
    Name = "DevSecOps-Server"
  }
  root_block_device {
    volume_size = 25 
    volume_type = "gp3"
  }
}
```

```bash
#terraform.tf

terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "5.65.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = var.aws_region
}
```

```bash
#variables.tf

variable "aws_region" {
  description = "AWS region where resources will be provisioned"
  default     = "eu-west-1"
}

variable "ami_id" {
  description = "AMI ID for the EC2 instance"
  default     = "ami-085f9c64a9b75eed5"
}

variable "instance_type" {
  description = "Instance type for the EC2 instance"
  default     = "t2.large"
}

variable "my_enviroment" {
  description = "Instance type for the EC2 instance"
  default     = "dev"
}
```

```bash
#outputs.tf

output "public_ip" {
  value = aws_instance.testinstance.public_ip
}
```

* In our `ec2.tf` file, you can observe that it requests a public key in terraform directory. Let's proceed to create it:
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1736909161490/42b9d53a-1c89-48d4-bacf-ee60118fa873.png align="left")

![]( align="center")

```bash
cd  terraform  

ssh-keygen

#give input as "bankapp-automate-key"
```

* You will find private and public key has been created:
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1736909243666/c7730017-8bcb-4d7f-83c5-4c40c5cfc879.png align="left")

4. Now apply all terraform changes:
    

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

* Now you can view the public IP. Let's attempt to connect to it using SSH.
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1737558546924/1b541cc4-348f-4207-a9ed-724f99dacfb0.png align="center")

```bash
ssh -i "key" "user"@"public_ip"
```

* You will see that our Ubuntu instance is now connected.
    

What are we accomplishing by doing this?

* Up to this point, we have successfully created a machine named \[**DevSecOps-Automation-Server**\], as illustrated in the image below.
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1737559715178/ceaf7064-e876-4cdc-aefa-e0f5b907be95.png align="center")

## Steps to create Docker **(2nd Step)**

Lets try to create a docker for our server.

1. Let's create a Dockerfile.
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1737561041471/68c0a163-e750-4c1d-b901-75c4fa3029ce.png align="left")

2. The Dockerfile is designed for a Maven-based project. Let’s create it.
    

```bash
#Dockerfile
# ----- Stage 1 -----
FROM maven:3.8.3-openjdk-17

WORKDIR /src

COPY . /src

#Maven through jar file will generate
RUN mvn clean install -DskipTests=true

# ----- Stage 2 -----
#FROM work is to run the jar file

FROM openjdk:17-alpine

COPY --from=builder /src/target/*.jar /src/target/bankapp.jar
#Copying From builder
#Maven will put compiled java classes into /src/target/* folder
#Copy To Current Stage /src/target/classname.jar
EXPOSE 8080

CMD [ "java", "-jar", "/src/target/bankapp.jar" ]
```

3. Build the Dockerfile to create an image & before that create a PAT token on Docker Hub
    

* Go to **DockerHub → Account Setting → Personal Access Token → Generate New Token**
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1737563685104/650e9d0a-3c4c-4f9c-aed9-cbd1afcf1a8f.png align="center")

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1737563895054/fd9a6b8c-4153-4e05-95f8-fe4c5aaa691d.png align="center")

* Now build the dockerfile
    

```bash
docker build -t bankapp:latest .
```

*Note: <mark>Ensure Docker Desktop is running before executing the command, as it acts as the Docker daemon. Without it, the CLI cannot connect, leading to build errors.</mark>*

* Let’s create a new branch:
    

```bash
git checkout -b mega-project
```

* Add sensitive files like keys and `terraform.lock.hcl` into `.gitignore`
    
* Go to Source Control on VS Code, and add these files in `.gitignore` file.
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1737571347719/a9921cbd-dcf8-40c2-bde0-a3ac81b0a277.png align="center")

* Perform below command:
    

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Added Terraform & Docker"
git push origin mega-project
```

* Connect to the EC2 instance from your local machine. Occasionally, you might encounter an error when building the image due to the Docker daemon not running. To address this, you can perform the steps directly on the EC2 instance. I have provided both sets of instructions, so you can choose either option.
    

```bash
ssh -i "private_key" "user"@"public_ip"
ssh -i bankapp-automate-key ubuntu@52.209.235.27

#How to get public ip
terraform output
```

* Update the system & install docker
    

```bash
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install docker.io -y

sudo usermod -aG docker $USER && newgrp docker
```

* Clone the code again:
    

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chetan-Mohod/DevSecOps-Project.git

git checkout mega-project
```

* Docker login
    

```bash
docker login -u "username"
```

* Now, build the image here:
    

```bash
docker build -t bankapp:latest .

docker images
```

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1737573570104/52c0bfce-50e4-4484-98ce-220b721e86ea.png align="left")

You can see that our image has been successfully created.

**To understand how the flow works, refer to the image below:**

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1737574330735/d7d2a6ee-b151-4ad5-b310-82ef67683f9f.png align="center")

## EKS Cluster:

Follow the steps to create EKS cluster:

1. First we want AWS CLI:
    
    * Download aws cli v2: [Link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
        
    * We can create an EKS cluster using Terraform, but using EKS CTL is also an option and is even simpler.
        

```bash
#Go to home directory and execute below command:
sudo apt install unzip

curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install
```

2. Now perform some configurations:
    

```bash
aws configure

#Add AWS Access Key & Password
```

3. Create an IAM user and create access key, refer this blog for the creation of the key.
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1737575232087/ad02929b-cc11-46fc-8130-139db25ed4da.png align="center")

* Add access key and secret
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1737575327021/777e953b-e760-4e0a-82b2-ca8c88ecf558.png align="left")

4. Now, we will install [eksctl](https://eksctl.io/installation/):
    

* Create a file named `install_eks.sh`.
    

```bash
#vim install_eks.sh

# for ARM systems, set ARCH to: `arm64`, `armv6` or `armv7`
ARCH=amd64
PLATFORM=$(uname -s)_$ARCH

curl -sLO "https://github.com/eksctl-io/eksctl/releases/latest/download/eksctl_$PLATFORM.tar.gz"

# (Optional) Verify checksum
curl -sL "https://github.com/eksctl-io/eksctl/releases/latest/download/eksctl_checksums.txt" | grep $PLATFORM | sha256sum --check

tar -xzf eksctl_$PLATFORM.tar.gz -C /tmp && rm eksctl_$PLATFORM.tar.gz

sudo mv /tmp/eksctl /usr/local/bin
```

```bash
chmod 700 install_eks.sh

./install_eks.sh

eksctl version
```

* Our eksctl has been installed.
    

**What can we do with eksctl?**

* By typing the `eksctl` command, you can create resources, drain nodes, delete clusters, and more.
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1737575853713/325ea2b9-76fb-43d6-9eb3-96dc6dc06c05.png align="center")

### What is Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)?

* EKS is a managed Kubernetes cluster service.
    
* You only need to create resources like pods, deployments, and services, and EKS will handle the management for you.
    
* The cluster control plane is hosted on AWS EKS, ensuring it is managed efficiently.
    

Now, we will focus on creating the worker nodes as depicted in the diagram. In the EKS service, AWS manages the master node, which controls access. Our responsibility is to manage the worker nodes.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1737576297082/597bd335-3a8d-492c-9b50-d4530ac6ed7e.png align="center")

* In Kubernetes, there is a Controller Manager. However, in the case of EKS, there is an additional service called the Cloud Controller Manager (CCM). This is the only difference between the two.
    

5. **Create EKS Cluster:**
    

```bash
eksctl create cluster --name=bankapp-cluster1 --region=eu-west-1 --version=1.31 --without-nodegroup
```

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1737659141781/ffd9ac55-4881-4b4a-9292-97df35c65f43.png align="center")

Our EKS Cluster is now ready. However, it indicates that `kubectl` is not found, so we need to install `kubectl`:

Let's install kubectl by following this [link](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/).

```bash
curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"

curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl.sha256"

echo "$(cat kubectl.sha256)  kubectl" | sha256sum --check

sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl

kubectl version --client
```

The following topic is provided for informational purposes. You may skip it if you wish and continue reading after this section concludes:

* EKS created using tool called as **<mark>CloudFormation</mark>,** AWS CloudFormation is like Terraform but specific to AWS it lets you define and manage cloud resources using code, like a blueprint for your infrastructure.
    
* Search for CloudFormation on AWS, and you will see the following screen.
    

![Knowledge Purpose](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1737654658351/a0813d15-f2de-4445-bfd7-a5fe3514f3b0.png align="center")

* **Stacks**: It is a collection of AWS resources that you create and manage together as a single unit using a template.
    
* So the cluster which we created it will show what will be created in it like ControlPlaneSecurityGroup, InternetGateway, etc.
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1737655212793/0dade5b8-21cb-4615-a732-001546429ee1.png align="center")

* Whenever you create a Kubernetes Cluster with EKS, a new VPC is generated specifically for your use, rather than using the default VPC.
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1737656326352/86f61abb-6809-4b67-b91f-6495467e311b.png align="center")

* This is the template for **CloudFormation**, and we don't need to write it manually. Instead, we can use tools like the **<mark>Serverless framework</mark>**.
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1737656541620/fdf7b446-1d87-4543-a154-57c7856fee0d.png align="center")

* [**Serverless framework**](https://www.serverless.com/framework): To create infrastructure on AWS Lambda, you can use the Serverless framework. For creating infrastructure on EKS, you can use eksctl.
    
* If we want to create APIs, we don't need to build everything from scratch. We can directly use the **Serverless** framework.
    

---

---

* The `kubectl` command-line tool is used to interact with the Kubernetes API server. Let's try to retrieve the nodes:
    

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

* Why are the nodes not showing? This is because when we created the EKS Cluster, we only set up the cluster itself, which is managed by AWS. We did not manage or add any nodes.
    
* Let's add the nodes, but first, we need to add the IAM OIDC provider.
    

### What is OIDC Provider?

* When you attach any service to AWS, you need to create an Open ID Connect (OIDC) user, which is an IAM user.
    
* You can integrate any AWS resource into the EKS service. When you want to add a node group (one or more instances), you need to use `associate-iam-oidc-provider`. This enables the EKS service to attach nodes.
    
* For example, if a guest wants to visit your apartment, and we provide them with an OIDC (like an ID card or approval from the myGate app), they don't need to register as a user or tenant. We are simply granting them access.
    
* IAM (Identity and Access Management) enables access to AWS services. OIDC is categorized under Identity providers within IAM.
    

```bash
eksctl utils associate-iam-oidc-provider --region=eu-west-1 --cluster=bankapp-cluster1 --approve
```

### How to validate?

Go to the AWS Console -&gt; IAM -&gt; Identity Provider

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1737921644634/b04ddc0c-6055-4f6f-a3b9-4c4170d43716.png align="center")

Now, anyone from my region can connect.

* Let’s create node group, so we can run our nodes.
    

```bash
eksctl create nodegroup --cluster=bankapp-cluster2 --region=eu-west-1 --name=bankapp-ng --node-type=t2.medium --nodes=2 --nodes-min=2 --nodes-max=2 --node-volume-size=15 --ssh-access --ssh-public-key=bankapp-automate-key
```

`nodegroup`: This refers to a group that contains one or more nodes.

`--node-type`: Instance type

* Once we execute the above command, all the specified resources are created using a **CloudFormation Stack**.
    
* Now if we go to CloudFormation → Stacks, here you will find one more stack for our node group.
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1738004356543/7d641789-93d3-4264-a7fc-a6f3a2591003.png align="center")

* Here node group created where you can find NodeInstanceRole, ManagedNodeGroup, SSH, etc.
    
* Now, when we run `kubectl get nodes`, we will not see the control-plane node because it is managed by AWS.
