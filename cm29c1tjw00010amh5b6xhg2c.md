## What is DevOps?

**Let me explain it like a Story** Imagine you're at a chaotic restaurant. In the back, there's the kitchen (developers) cooking up fantastic dishes, and out front, there‚Äôs the waitstaff (operations), delivering meals to the customers. Traditionally, these two groups rarely talk directly and when they do, it's often rushed, and meals get delayed, mistakes happen, and customers leave unhappy which is not good.

Now, picture a smooth running joint where the chefs and waiters work in perfect unity. This is DevOps. In a DevOps world, everyone‚Äôs communicating, the kitchen knows what's happening out front, and vice versa. Orders come in, meals go out, and the guests are thrilled. This is how DevOps works.

In simple words, DevOps is a mindset to automate things.

### DevOps Architecture

### **What is Automation, Scaling, and Infrastructure?**

**1\. Automation in DevOps:** Imagine you have to bake dozens of cakes. Doing it manually would be exhausting and slow. Automation is like having a machine that mixes, bakes, and decorates the cakes for you. In DevOps, automation uses tools to handle repetitive tasks (like testing and deploying code) so developers can focus on more important things.

**Example:** Instead of manually checking if your website works after every small change, automated tests run automatically and tell you if something is broken. It‚Äôs like having an auto-baker that alerts you if a cake doesn‚Äôt rise properly!

**2\. Scaling in DevOps:** Think of scaling like expanding a restaurant. When more customers show up, you don‚Äôt want them waiting forever. Scaling ensures you can handle more traffic without slowing down. In DevOps, scaling means adding more servers or resources as needed to maintain performance.

**Example:** If your online store has a huge sale, scaling lets your website handle the increased traffic without crashing. It‚Äôs like adding more tables and chefs to your restaurant during a big event.

**3\. Infrastructure in DevOps:** Infrastructure is like the foundation and setup of your restaurant‚Äîthe kitchen, tables, staff, etc. In DevOps, infrastructure includes servers, networks, and all the technology that supports your applications.

**Example:** You can set up your infrastructure using code (called Infrastructure as Code). This is like having a blueprint for your restaurant so you can quickly set up new branches with the same quality and layout. If one branch faces issues, you can replicate and launch another one smoothly.

So, in a nutshell: **Automation** streamlines repetitive tasks, **Scaling** ensures you can handle growth, and **Infrastructure** is the solid foundation everything runs on. It‚Äôs like running a top-notch restaurant where everything works seamlessly, no matter how many customers come in or how many cakes you need to bake. üç∞üçΩÔ∏è

## Why DevOps is Important?

**Scenario:** Imagine a football (soccer) team. Before DevOps, you have the attackers (developers) practicing separately from the defenders and goalkeepers (operations). Come match day, they haven‚Äôt coordinated their strategies, leading to a disjointed game, miscommunication, and likely a loss.

**Implementing DevOps:**

1. **Unified Training Sessions (Continuous Integration)**:
    
    * The entire team trains together, understanding each other‚Äôs strengths and strategies. Attackers know when to push forward, defenders know how to back them up, and the goalkeeper coordinates the defense.
        
    * Result: During the match, everyone is on the same page, making swift, coordinated plays that catch the opponent off guard.
        
2. **In-Game Adjustments (Continuous Deployment)**:
    
    * The coach (DevOps manager) continuously monitors the game, making quick adjustments based on real-time performance. New strategies (features) are introduced seamlessly during the game.
        
    * Result: The team adapts to the opponent‚Äôs tactics instantly, ensuring they stay ahead and maintain control.
        
3. **Pre-Match Analysis (Infrastructure as Code)**:
    
    * The team uses data and analytics to prepare for each game, creating detailed plans (infrastructure scripts) to replicate successful setups.
        
    * Result: Consistent performance and quick recovery from any setbacks. If a player gets injured (server crash), a substitute with the same preparation steps in seamlessly.
        

**Funny Example in Action:**

* Without DevOps: During a critical moment, the attackers push forward while the defenders stay back, leading to a massive gap and an easy goal for the opponent. The goalkeeper is left waving their arms in frustration, like a person trying to catch confetti in a storm.
    
* With DevOps: The team executes a perfect counter-attack. The attackers and defenders move as one, the goalkeeper orchestrates from the back, and they score a stunning goal. The fans (users) are ecstatic and chant in unison, praising the teamwork and flawless execution.
    

**Impact in the Organization:**

With DevOps, the organization becomes a well-coordinated team, where every member knows their role and works in harmony. Just like a football team playing a beautiful game, the development and operations teams collaborate seamlessly, delivering continuous value to the users and adapting swiftly to any challenges.

So, think of DevOps as turning your organization into a champion football team that always plays a beautiful, winning game. ‚öΩüèÜ

### How to become DevOps Engineer?

* Learn basic Linux commands. ( *I‚Äôll share more blogs regarding Linux shell scripting*)
    
* Learn Python for Automation.
    
* Learn how to use Git and platforms like GitHub or GitLab.
    
* For Continuous Integration(CI) learn Jenkins.
    
* For Containers learn Docker and Kubernetes.
    
* Learn how to automate and manage configurations at scale with the help of Ansible.
    
* Learn Terraform to manage your infrastructure through code.
    
* Start with any Cloud platform like AZURE, AWS, GCP.
    

DevOps is ever-evolving. Follow blogs, join forums, and take up continuous learning courses.
