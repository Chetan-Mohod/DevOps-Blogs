When creating resources on AWS, it is important for Terraform to know which AWS account is being used.

**Prerequisites:**

1. **IAM (Identity and Access Management) User**: Terraform needs an IAM user to identify itself to AWS.
    
2. **AWS CLI**: The AWS Command Line Interface should be set up.
    
3. **Provider**: The AWS provider must be installed in Terraform.
    
4. **Terraform File**: A configuration file is required to define the resources.
    

### 1\. IAM User:

1. When using Terraform to create resources on AWS, it is essential to establish a connection between Terraform and AWS. To accomplish any task on AWS, you need an IAM user.
    

Follow these steps to create **IAM** user:

1. Navigate to **IAM** on AWS console, then select **Users** and click on **Create User**:
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1733577508146/1a5c3c8b-6659-4bfb-bc21-ce60c4ff4ac6.png align="center")

2. Follow below steps:
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1733577574921/2296a181-0522-4190-b71c-dfa7edb51bd3.png align="center")

Our user requires certain permissions, so select "Attach policies directly". In this example, we are granting Admin access. However, in a production environment, it is not advisable to provide Admin access. Instead, assign a role that matches the specific tasks, such as creating an AWS S3 bucket or an EC2 instance.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1733577657710/61afb7d5-ad94-4723-892e-a2c4745f3d0d.png align="center")

Alternatively, you can grant the following permissions for creating DynamoDB, EC2 instances, VPC, and S3 Buckets.

Click on "Create User".

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1733577906594/80ddcd1d-04c3-460e-bd40-dae2a2959183.png align="center")

### 2\. AWS CLI:

**Setup user on our server:** To setup a user on our server we need command line interface AWS CLI.

Steps:

1. Go to browser and search “AWS CLI V2 Install“. *Here CLI latest version is V2.*
    

Or [Click Here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) for steps.

```bash
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install
```

It will download the AWS CLI from the specified location, unzip it, and then install it.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1733578588480/58c5ac3e-107f-4a03-b05c-db9f3b41d15e.png align="center")

If unzip is not installed at your machine then install it.

```bash
sudo apt-get install unzip
```

Now, unzip the AWS CLI zip file that we downloaded:

```bash
unzip awscliv2.zip
```

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1733578703138/f2728e91-0b55-46aa-8862-5152340baa50.png align="left")

Now run below command:

```bash
sudo ./aws/install
```

Now you AWS CLI is installed, you can run `aws --version` .

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1733578826056/46b736fe-9a2e-4317-9263-0cf08f3121b0.png align="left")

**Bind an IAM User to an EC2 Instance:**

Now, we will associate the user we created, "**terra-admin**" with our AWS EC2 instance “**terraform-server**”.

Steps:

1. Go to EC2 isntance and do AWS configure:
    

```bash
aws configure
```

Now it will prompt you to enter the AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1733579424012/58dc9232-f226-4233-82a3-09b3f2ef4d10.png align="left")

2. Navigate to the "terra-admin" user, then proceed to the Security Credentials section to create an Access Key.
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1733579578208/850afaf7-fc70-4d83-99ab-70b7e115d237.png align="center")

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1733579609732/0f362a94-6c0e-49a0-bb3d-9f5129fde17e.png align="center")

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1733579658738/102a1a9a-d4a2-4ac4-867e-087f2779626f.png align="center")

Now your access key will be created.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1733579859906/e0c7734a-b211-40f3-bf0c-4874cea0ce5a.png align="center")

3. Copy the Access Key and Secret Access Key, then paste them into the EC2 instance.
    
4. After this, running `aws s3 ls` will display all the available S3 buckets.
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1733580050127/af5d1f61-4b57-440b-bf5b-66310367eb33.png align="left")

Now, our instance is successfully connected to the AWS account.

### 3.Provider:

Now, we need to install AWS plugins into Terraform to enable connectivity with AWS.

Steps:

1. To find the AWS Terraform provider, you can search for "aws terraform provider" in your browser or [click here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs).
    
2. Click on “USE PROVIDER“ and copy and paste that code
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1733580652420/8e022b70-f65b-4ce6-a0d6-a6009e7a31fa.png align="center")

### 4.Terraform File:

Steps:

1. Go to the instance and create a `terraform.tf` file to add the providers.
    

```bash
cd terraform-practice/

vim terraform.tf
```

Why do we name the file `terraform.tf`? This is because it will contain all the provider configurations related to Terraform.

2. Paste the code here and add region in arguments for Instance:
    

```bash
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "5.80.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-1"
}
```

Refer to the screenshot below to obtain the region argument.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1733581622617/7afe690f-2ca5-4c8f-a3a6-b544ba1266fa.png align="center")

3. **Terraform Init:** The `terraform init` command installs the necessary components specified in the Terraform block. In this case, it installs the AWS provider.
    

```bash
terraform init
```

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1733581922211/5742901c-28cf-4ca8-ab3c-5d07a946b763.png align="center")

Navigate to the `terraform-practice` directory and run the `ls -a` command. You will see all the providers installed within the `.terraform` directory.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1733582112203/5157d93c-f237-4c7c-852d-e5a81d5413c1.png align="center")

### Create AWS S3 Bucket, EC2 Instance:

Steps to create S3 bucket & EC2 instance with terraform:

**S3 Bucket:**

1. Create s3.tf file:
    

```bash
vim s3.tf
```

```bash
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "my_bucket" {
  bucket = "acrobat-bucket"
  tags = {
    Name        = "My first bucket"
    Environment = "Dev"
  }
}
```

How did I write this code?

Did I do it on my own?

No, I referred the HashiCorp's official [Terraform](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/s3_bucket) documentation.

2. Terraform plan & Terraform apply:
    

```bash
terraform plan

terraform apply
```

You can observe that the S3 bucket has been successfully created. It’s quite easy right?

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1733582655865/db939294-86ed-4c00-971e-f01261ec3309.png align="center")

**EC2 Instance:**

1. Create ec2.tf file:
    

```bash
vim ec2.tf
```

```bash
resource "aws_instance" "my_instance" {
  ami           = "ami-0e9085e60087ce171"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "terraform-generated-ec2"
  }
}
```

Refer to HashiCorp's official [Terraform](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/instance) documentation for the EC2 instance code.

How to find the AMI ID?

Click on "Launch Instance" in the specific region where you are creating your EC2 instance, and then follow these steps:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1733583063319/edf8ff51-9cba-4434-8d58-ee5b4358ea43.png align="center")

You will notice that your AWS EC2 Instance has been successfully created.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1733583635586/bf5093ad-d0f1-4d03-a7ba-fc8f19b131b8.png align="center")

By the way, this instance will not be functional because, to create an instance, we need to provide a key pair, storage, security group, and VPC ID. Here, I'm just explaining the concept in simple terms. We will create a fully functional instance later.

2. We will list our terraform which we created by running `terraform state list:`
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1733585335739/1266115b-db6b-4b55-944e-9c9bb44519b7.png align="center")

3. To delete only the EC2 instance, use the following `terraform destroy --target` command to remove a specific Terraform resource:
    

```bash
terraform destroy --target=aws_instance.my_instance
```

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1733585541960/1a6cbf88-f727-4d5e-9e87-69239d272c17.png align="center")

### Create a Working EC2 Instance: A Real-Life Scenario Practice Used in the Industry

> Prerequisite: Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). And install HashiCorp Terraform extension.

**Steps to follow to create an instance:**

When you click on "Launch Instance" in the AWS console, it opens a form page. This page can guide you in writing your code.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1733594601295/d2cc0dbc-8d99-4e0f-84d6-d72136ddc062.png align="center")

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1733594639119/e45dc6f9-e49e-43c8-bea7-dd7c5d894ff4.png align="center")

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1733594658565/4f288311-e3ed-4f8b-9427-12eb07c531cc.png align="left")

1. Create a folder named `terraform-practice` in **Visual Studio Code** on your **local machine**. Inside this folder, create a file called `terraform.tf` to add the providers.
    

```bash
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-1"  #Ireland Region
}
```

2. Next, we will create an EC2 Instance. Start by creating a file named `ec2.tf`:
    

I will divide the file into different sections such as key pair, security group, and storage. Finally, I will combine the code.

* **Create Key-Pair:**
    

```bash
#Key-Pair
resource "aws_key_pair" "my-key" {
  key_name = "acrobat-terraform-key"
  public_key = file("acrobat-terraform-key.pub")
}
```

Here, we need to specify the `public_key`, which we must generate by running the `ssh-keygen` command as shown in below screenshot.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1733596030772/0954cc05-fa1b-4da2-9a6e-06019af46266.png align="center")

After generating the key in our folder, we will take the public key name, highlighted in green, and include it in our code under the public key arguments. Alternatively, you can directly add the public key instead of using the file function. As mentioned in ([Documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/key_pair)).

* **Default VPC (Network Setting):**
    

```bash
resource "aws_default_vpc" "default"{

}
```

The default VPC is automatically provided and cannot be configured. It is set up by default.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1733597907306/7e911655-9e29-4a92-bd8f-566f3071d117.png align="center")

* **Firewall (Security Group):** Refer to the [Documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/security_group) for the necessary code.
    

To write the code for the security group of an EC2 Instance, refer to the Security Group page.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1733633097169/9a557030-29e1-41a4-a0a6-5bc69903e7b6.png align="center")

```bash
resource "aws_security_group" "my_sg" {
  name = "Z plus security"
  description = "This is a security grp created by Terraform"
  vpc_id = aws_default_vpc.default.id    #This is called interpolatiion
  ingress {    #Inbound Rule
    description = "Allow access to SSH port 22"
    from_port = 22
    to_port = 22
    protocol = "tcp" 
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]    #Anywhere around the IP access grant
  }
  ingress {    #Inbound Rule
    description = "Allow access to SSH port 80"
    from_port = 80
    to_port = 80
    protocol = "tcp" 
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
  egress {   #Outbound Rule
    description = "allow all outgoing traffice"
    to_port = 0
    from_port = 0
    protocol = "-1"    #Why -1? Outgoing traffic to everytype HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, etc
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
  tags ={
    Name = "Z plus security"
  }
}
```

* **What is Interpolation?**
    
    —&gt; “`vpc_id = aws_default_vpc.default.id`“
    
    —&gt; In this example, `aws_default_vpc` is a resource type, and within it, you have created a resource. You can create multiple resources within this type.
    
    —&gt;Interpolation in Terraform refers to the capability to access values from resources arguments and attributes.
    
* **AWS Instance:**
    

```bash
resource "aws_instance" "my_instance" {
    ami = "ami-0e9085e60087ce171"
    instance_type = "t2.micro"
    security_groups = [aws_security_group.my_sg.name] #Interpolation
    key_name = aws_key_pair.my-key.key_name #Interpolation
    root_block_device {    #Storage, Volume, EBS
      volume_size = 10
      volume_type = "gp3"
    }
    tags = {
        Name = "Chetan-Auto-Server"  #Instance Name
    }
}
```

* We have written this code on a local machine, so we need to configure AWS on it.
    
* To access our EC2 Instance credentials, navigate to the `.aws` folder on your local machine. Here, you will find the saved credentials.
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1733634276908/053cbeba-5ce9-46a9-8818-430c0b1890b5.png align="center")

* Add those credentials to VS Code. Then, run the command `aws s3 ls` to view all the buckets you have created.
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1733634600139/cd5802a6-7ee2-4d00-975d-342a4d8fde62.png align="center")

Now, let's create our EC2 Instance from VS Code using Terraform by following these terraform commands:

```bash
terraform init

terraform fmt  #Format the code properly

terraform plan

terraform apply
```

Once you apply the changes, you will see that your EC2 Instance has been successfully created.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1733637684241/bb6dc7b6-25ad-460e-8775-0a01fc658c37.png align="center")

Now we can connect to this instance. Since we don't have a `.pem` key, we will grant permissions to the `acrobat-terraform-key` and use this key to establish the connection.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1733638910145/0a69e42a-aa60-4246-843f-777cebb489e9.png align="center")

If you are using Windows, use the following command to grant read permission to a key:

```bash
icacls "acrobat-terraform-key" /inheritance:r
icacls "acrobat-terraform-key" /grant:r "%username%:R"
```

Now, perform an SSH connection, and you will be connected to the EC2 Instance.

Now you can remove your instance using the `terraform destroy` command.

This is the process for creating and destroying an EC2 Instance using Terraform Automation.
