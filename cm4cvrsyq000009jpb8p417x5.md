Terraform is a tool that allows you do IAC(Infrastructure as a Code) so that DevOps and Development teams can automate or Replicate the cloud Infrastructure provisioning(create) using code.

## Why Choose Terraform?

Before Terraform, setting up infrastructure felt like running a marathon in the dark. Imagine this: your team needs a solid environment for a new application, and every step is manual and messy. You need a network admin to configure routers, a storage admin to allocate space, system engineers to provision servers, backup admins for data safety, and an application team to tie it all together. Each step is manual, error-prone, and requires constant coordination among teams.

Now, multiply this effort by every time you need to replicate the setup for a new client, test environment, or recovery scenario. It's like building the same house repeatedly, brick by brick, from scratch. Mistakes were inevitable. A misplaced configuration or a missing step could cost days of troubleshooting and a lot of frustration. Plus, this manual approach drained resources and budgets.

**Challenges of IT Infrastructures:**

1. **Slow Deployment**: Setting up infrastructure manually can be time-consuming, delaying project timelines.
    
2. **Expensive**: Manual processes often lead to higher costs due to increased labor and resource use.
    
3. **Limited Automation**: Without automation, repetitive tasks must be done manually, reducing efficiency.
    
4. **Human Error**: Manual setups are prone to mistakes, which can lead to system failures and require additional troubleshooting.
    
5. **Wasted Resources**: Inefficient processes can lead to unnecessary use of resources, increasing operational costs.
    
6. **Inconsistency**: Manual configurations can result in variations between environments, leading to unpredictable performance.

Terraform revolutionized this process. Instead of repetitive manual setups, it introduced Infrastructure as Code (IaC). With Terraform, you write the instructions for your entire infrastructure just once in code. This code is reusable, shareable, and scalable. Whether you're setting up one server or a hundred, for one client or many, it's just a matter of running the code.

The errors? Gone. The inefficiency? Eliminated. Terraform doesn’t just save time it transforms how teams collaborate. Everyone speaks the same "language," and the infrastructure is consistent, no matter how many times you deploy it.

It’s like going from handcrafting every house to having a blueprint you can use to build as many as you want with precision and speed. That’s the power of Terraform.

* **Dev/DevOps**: Facilitates collaboration between development and operations teams.
    
* **Automation**: Streamlines processes through automated infrastructure management.
    
* **Code (Infrastructure)**: Manages infrastructure using code for consistency and efficiency.
    
* **Replicate**: Easily duplicates infrastructure setups across different environments.
    

### What is Infrastructure?

**What can you create on cloud providers?** You can set up resources like Virtual Machines, Databases, Relational Databases, Load Balancers, Clusters, and Networks, among others. This collection of resources is referred to as Infrastructure.

We can automate this infrastructure by using tools such as **<mark>Terraform</mark>**.

To manage the configuration of infrastructure, there is a tool known as Ansible.
