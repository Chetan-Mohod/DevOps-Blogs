### **What is Observability?**

Observability helps you understand what’s happening inside your system by analyzing the outputs it generates like figuring out why a car is making noise by listening to it.

### **Pillars of Observability**

1. **Monitoring (<mark>WHY</mark>** is your application slow, off, etc)
    
    * **Definition:** Collecting and analyzing metrics over time to identify system performance trends, availability, and resource utilization.
        
    * **Purpose:** Alerts when predefined thresholds are breached, ensuring system reliability.
        
    * **Example Metrics:** CPU usage, memory consumption, request latency, error rates.
        
    * **Tools:** Prometheus, Datadog, Grafana.
        
2. **Logging (<mark>WHAT</mark>** is going on your application)
    
    * **Definition:** Capturing and storing structured or unstructured event data generated by applications and systems.
        
    * **Purpose:** Provides granular details about specific events, such as errors or state changes, enabling root cause analysis.
        
    * **Example:** An error log showing why a transaction failed.
        
    * **Tools:** ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Splunk, Fluentd.
        
3. **Tracing (<mark>HOW</mark>** to reach)
    
    * **Definition:** Tracks the flow of requests through a distributed system, following them across services and components.
        
    * **Purpose:** Helps visualize and analyze service dependencies and pinpoint bottlenecks or latency issues.
        
    * **Example:** A trace showing the time taken by each microservice to process a request in a distributed architecture.
        
    * **Tools:** Jaeger, OpenTelemetry, Zipkin.
        

### **Example**

Imagine your website is slow.

* **Monitoring** shows high CPU usage on one server.
    
* **Logging** reveals an error in the checkout process.
    
* **Tracing** pinpoints the delay in the payment gateway call.
