When working with Docker, particularly when defining services in **docker-compose.yml**, the **CMD** instruction plays a crucial role in specifying the default command that gets executed when a container starts. In the context of Docker Compose, you'll often see two styles of defining this **CMD**: **CMD (Exec Form)** and **CMD (Shell Form)**. These two approaches have subtle but important differences that can impact how your containers behave.

In this blog, we’ll explore these two forms, their usage, and when you might want to choose one over the other.

---

### 1\. What is CMD in Docker?

Before diving into the difference between **CMD Shell** and **CMD Exec** forms, let's review what `CMD` does in Docker:

* **CMD** specifies the default command that should run inside your container.
    
* It provides the arguments to pass to the container's main process when no other command is specified during the container startup.
    

For example, in a simple Dockerfile:

**FROM ubuntu**

**CMD \["echo", "Hello, World!"\]**

Here, **CMD** tells Docker to run the **echo "Hello, World!"** command whenever the container starts. If you run the container without specifying any other command, this is what will run.

### 2\. CMD Forms in Docker

There are two main ways to specify the **CMD** instruction:

#### 2.1. **Exec Form (CMD)**

This is the recommended and most common way to specify a command in Docker. In the **Exec Form**, the command and its arguments are defined as a JSON array, where each part of the command is a separate string. For example:

**services:  
app:  
image: ubuntu  
command: \["echo", "Hello, World!"\]**

* The command is passed directly to the kernel for execution without involving a shell.
    
* This form is more efficient and safer because no shell is involved, which means it avoids potential issues like shell word splitting or unexpected variable expansions.
    

Example:

**CMD \["myapp", "--flag", "value"\]**

This will execute the **myapp --flag value** command without invoking a shell, reducing the risk of issues like unwanted globbing or variable expansion.

#### 2.2. **Shell Form (CMDSHELL)**

In the **Shell Form**, the command is written as a single string, just like how you'd type it into a terminal. For example:

**services:  
app:  
image: ubuntu  
command: echo Hello, World!**

* In this case, Docker will automatically run the command using a shell (typically **/bin/sh -c** in Linux environments).
    
* This form allows for more flexibility, such as using shell features like environment variables, wildcards, and pipes.
    

Example:

**CMD echo "Hello, World!"**

This translates to **/bin/sh -c "echo 'Hello, World!'"**, meaning a shell is invoked before the command runs.

### 3\. Differences Between Exec Form and Shell Form

Now that we understand the two forms, let’s break down their differences:

| Feature | **Exec Form** | **Shell Form** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Command Syntax** | JSON array: **\["command", "arg1"\]** | String: **"command arg1 arg2"** |
| **Shell Involvement** | No (direct execution) | Yes (uses **/bin/sh -c**) |
| **Use of Environment Vars** | Requires explicit handling | Automatically available |
| **Wildcard & Globbing** | No shell features | Full shell capabilities |
| **Security** | Safer (no shell expansion issues) | Can be vulnerable to shell injection |
| **Portability** | More portable across environments | Shell behavior may vary |

### 4\. When to Use Each Form

Choosing between **CMD Exec** and **CMD Shell** depends on your specific use case. Here’s a quick guide:

#### Use **CMD Exec** when:

* You want a more **secure** and **efficient** execution.
    
* The command is simple and doesn’t need shell features like piping or variable expansion.
    
* You’re building for portability across different environments.
    
* You want to avoid shell injection vulnerabilities.
    

For example, when running a well-defined binary like:

**CMD \["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"\]**

#### Use **CMD Shell** when:

* You need the flexibility of a **shell**.
    
* You want to use shell-specific features like environment variables, pipes, or conditional execution (**&&**, **||**).
    
* The command you’re running requires a shell environment.
    

For example, when you need to execute complex commands:

**CMD echo "The current user is: $USER"**

In this case, the shell form is ideal because **$USER** is a shell environment variable that gets expanded before the command is run.

### 5\. Example in Docker Compose

Let’s consider a simple **docker-compose.yml** file that uses both forms:

**version: "3"  
services:  
app\_exec:  
image: busybox  
command: \["echo", "Exec form: Hello, World!"\]**

**app\_shell:  
image: busybox  
command: echo "Shell form: Hello, World!"**

* **app\_exec** uses the **Exec Form** and will directly run the **echo** command without invoking a shell.
    
* **app\_shell** uses the **Shell Form**, so the command will be passed to **/bin/sh -c**, allowing for shell-specific behavior (e.g., environment variable expansion).
    

Running **docker-compose up** will output:

**app\_exec\_1 | Exec form: Hello, World!  
app\_shell\_1 | Shell form: Hello, World!**

Both containers will execute successfully, but the internal handling of the commands differs.

### 6\. Pros and Cons

#### **Exec Form Pros:**

* **Efficiency**: No shell overhead means faster execution.
    
* **Security**: Avoids the risk of shell injection attacks or accidental expansion.
    
* **Portability**: Works consistently across different environments (Windows, Linux).
    

#### **Exec Form Cons:**

* **Lack of Flexibility**: No access to shell features (pipes, environment variable expansion, etc.).
    

#### **Shell Form Pros:**

* **Flexibility**: Shell features like variable expansion, piping, and chaining (**&&**, **||**) are available.
    
* **Simplicity**: Easier to write simple commands, especially for developers familiar with shell syntax.
    

#### **Shell Form Cons:**

* **Security Risks**: Potential for shell injection or unintentional command behavior.
    
* **Performance Overhead**: Slightly slower due to the shell’s involvement.
    

### 7\. Conclusion

Both **Exec Form** and **Shell Form** have their advantages and are useful in different scenarios. The **Exec Form** is ideal for most applications where you don’t need shell-specific features, providing better performance and security. However, the **Shell Form** is useful when you need the flexibility of a shell environment.

In summary:

* **Use Exec Form** for straightforward, safer, and faster commands.
    
* **Use Shell Form** when you need to take advantage of shell features like environment variables or complex command chaining.
    

Understanding these differences and making the right choice for your Docker Compose configurations can lead to more efficient and secure container deployments.
