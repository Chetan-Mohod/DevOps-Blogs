Docker simplifies containerization, making it a must-have tool for DevOps. Here are the key commands that you’ll use regularly:

1. **docker pull** – Download images from Docker Hub to your local system. For example, **docker pull nginx** fetches the latest Nginx image.
    
2. **docker run** – Start a container from an image. Running **docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx** starts Nginx in detached mode, mapping port 8080 to 80.
    
3. **docker ps** – List all running containers. Add **\-a** to see all containers, including stopped ones.
    
4. **docker stop** – Gracefully stop a running container by specifying its ID or name.
    
5. **docker rm** – Remove stopped containers to keep your environment clean.
    
6. **docker rmi** – Delete unused images to free up space on your machine.
    
7. **docker exec** – Run commands inside a running container. For example, **docker exec -it \[container-id\] bash** opens a shell.
    
8. **docker build** – Build a custom image from a Dockerfile using **docker build -t \[image-name\] .**.
    
9. **docker logs** – View the logs of a running or stopped container to troubleshoot issues.
    
10. **docker-compose up** – Start multiple containers defined in a **docker-compose.yml** file. Use **\-d** to run in detached mode.
