### What are Playbooks and How to Write Them?

* A playbook is a configuration file where scripts are written.
    
* It is a straightforward YAML file that looks like this:
    

Let's consider a simple example to print the date. Create a file named `show_date.yml`.

```yaml
-
  name: Date playbook
  hosts: servers
  tasks:
    - name: Show date
      command: date
```

A playbook always begins with a “-”.

Lets run this playbook:

```bash
ansible-playbook show_date.yml
```

* The output will appear as follows:

* To check the output run below command:
    

```bash
ansible-playbook -v show_date.yml
```

* Using a playbook file, you can perform various checks on servers.
    

```bash
mv show_date.yml show_server_stats.yml

show_server_stats.yml
```

```yaml
-
  name: Date playbook
  hosts: servers
  tasks:
    - name: Show date
      command: date
    - name: Show RAM
      command: free -h
    - name: Show DISK
      command: df -h
    - name: Show uptime
      command: uptime
```

* Run the playbook:
    

```bash
ansible-playbook -v show_server_stats.yml
```

### Install docker on multiple servers:

* Let's create a script to install Docker “`install_docker.yml`“ on three different machines from the master server.
    

```yaml
-
  name: Install Docker
  hosts: servers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: install docker based on server distribution
      apt:            #apt built_module of ansible. Refer document and search apt in it, you will get the code.
        name: docker.io
        state: latest
      when: ansible_distribution == 'Debian' or ansible_distribution == 'Ubuntu'

    - name: install the latest version of docker based on distribution
      dnf:
        name: docker
        state: latest
      when: ansible_distribution == 'Amazon' or ansible_distribution == 'RedHat'
```

Here’s a simple explanation of the provided Ansible playbook:

1. `- name: Install Docker`  
    This is the name of the playbook, describing its purpose (to install Docker).
    
2. `hosts: servers`  
    Specifies that the playbook will run on the hosts group named "servers."
    
3. `become: yes`  
    Enables privilege escalation (sudo) to perform tasks as a superuser.
    
4. `tasks:`  
    Declares the list of tasks to be executed in this playbook.
    
5. `- name: install docker based on server distribution`  
    Names the first task, which installs Docker on Debian or Ubuntu systems.
    
6. `apt:`  
    Uses the `apt` module to manage packages on Debian-based distributions.
    
7. `name:` [`docker.io`](http://docker.io)  
    Specifies that the package to be installed is [`docker.io`](http://docker.io).
    
8. `state: latest`  
    Ensures the latest version of Docker is installed.
    
9. `when: ansible_distribution == 'Debian' or ansible_distribution == 'Ubuntu'`  
    Runs this task only if the server's operating system is Debian or Ubuntu.
    
10. `- name: install the latest version of docker based on distribution`  
    Names the second task, which installs Docker on Amazon Linux or Red Hat systems.
    
11. `dnf:`  
    Uses the `dnf` module to manage packages on Red Hat-based distributions.
    
12. `name: docker`  
    Specifies that the package to be installed is `docker`.
    
13. `state: latest`  
    Ensures the latest version of Docker is installed.
    
14. `when: ansible_distribution == 'Amazon' or ansible_distribution == 'RedHat'`  
    Runs this task only if the server's operating system is Amazon Linux or Red Hat.
    

* You can refer to the [Ansible Module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/modules/list_of_all_modules.html) documentation to write any ansible code.
    
* To list the available details for `ansible_distribution` on the system, execute the following command:
    

```bash
ansible servers -m setup | grep "ansible_distribution"
```

* Now we will run below command to install docker
    

```bash
ansible-playbook -v install_docker.yml
```

### Deploy Webpage with Ansible on Multiple Servers

To deploy a project using Ansible, follow these steps:

First, visit my [GitHub](https://github.com/Chetan-Mohod/Ansible-First-Deployment) repository. You have the option to fork the repository or copy the code for `index.html`.

Then, create a file named `deploy_webpage.yml` to facilitate the deployment of the webpage.

```yaml
-
  name: Deploy Webpage to nginx/apache
  become: yes
  hosts: servers
  tasks:
    - name: install nginx/apache
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: latest
      when: ansible_distribution == 'Ubuntu'

    - name: start nginx/apache
      service:
        name: nginx
        enabled: yes
      when: ansible_distribution == 'Ubuntu'

    - name: copy webpage to server destination
      copy:
        src: index.html
        dest: /var/www/html
      when: ansible_distribution == 'Ubuntu'
```

To view the webpage on server1, execute the deploy\_webpage.yml file.

```bash
ansible-playbook -v deploy_webpage.yml
```

To view the deployed webpage, obtain the public IP address of server1 of **Ubuntu** from AWS. Then, enter the following URL in your browser: `http://public_ip_server1`.

You will now see that our webpage has been successfully deployed.

Similarly we can deploy Webpage on other two servers **Amazon Linux 2** and **RedHat**.

Add below code into deploy\_webpage.yml file:

```yaml
-
  name: Deploy Webpage to nginx/apache
  become: yes
  hosts: servers
  tasks:
    - name: install nginx/apache
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: latest
      when: ansible_distribution == 'Ubuntu'

    - name: start nginx/apache
      service:
        name: nginx
        enabled: yes
      when: ansible_distribution == 'Ubuntu'

    - name: install nginx/apache
      dnf:
        name: httpd
        state: latest
      when: ansible_distribution == 'Amazon' or ansible_distribution == 'Redhat'

    - name: start nginx/apache
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: started
        enabled: yes
      when: ansible_distribution == 'Amazon' or ansible_distribution == 'Redhat'

    - name: copy webpage to server destination
      copy:
        src: index.html
        dest: /var/www/html
```

Now, copy the public IP addresses of the Amazon and RedHat servers. You will be able to see that your webpage has been successfully deployed.

## **Server Patching Playbook**

Refer this documentation for [update\_cache](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/apt_module.html#parameter-update_cache):

To create a server patching playbook, begin by creating a file named: `patch_servers.yml`.

```yaml
-
 name: Apply Patching Activity
 hosts: servers
 become: yes
 tasks:
   - name: Upgrade the servers
     apt:
       update_cache: yes
       upgrade: dist
     when: ansible_distribution == 'Ubuntu'

   - name: Upgrade the RHEL CentOS Packages
     dnf:
       name: "*"
       state: latest
     when: ansible_distribution in ['Amazon', 'Redhat']

   - name: Reboot the servers
     reboot:
       msg: "Rebooting servers: Patching activity in progress"
       reboot_timeout: 600
```

To execute this script, follow these steps:

```bash
ansible-playbook -v patch_servers.yml
```

This guide explains how to patch your servers using an Ansible Playbook.
